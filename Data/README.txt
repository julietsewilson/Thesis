DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA
Biochemical data measured in Atlantic cod, haddock, European hake and European glass eel muscle tissue samples, collected from a range of regions in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean in 2018.
Data includes stable isotope ratios, fatty acid compositions and trace element compositions measured by x-ray fluorescence (XRF).
